# **Hey everyone !** 😎

I'm Jasmine DRAPERI and I'm based in Grenoble, France.

I am currently looking for a fixed-term contract before starting a Master's degree in IT.

## Talk about me 🌺
I like the training I am currently taking, and I hope to be able to discover many more things! Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, drawing or hanging out with my friends and family!

## Projects 📚

My projects are done as part of my training. We do it every two weeks.
